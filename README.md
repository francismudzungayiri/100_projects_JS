# 100_projects_JS
This repo is for 100 Javascript projects

Project 001
    Concepts applied
    DOM - getting input data
        - Event listeners
        - date module

    Challenges 
        -Got stuck when I was trying to get input value to convert to string
        I was getting any empty value and trying to convert to date before 
        the eventlistener. 


Project 002
TIP CALCULATOR

In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator. The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS. We utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.

Concepts:
    DOM
    Eventlistiners
    getting input data


Project 003
BMI Calculator

This project aims to create a body mass index calculator. There are two input fields where the user can enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. By clicking the "compute BMI" button, the BMI will be calculated and displayed along with the weight condition, which is determined by if statements based on the BMI. We will also install the project with a neumorphism design and use JavaScript to calculate the BMI. All results will be displayed inside the input field and at the end of the container.

Concepts learned:
    CSS nuemorphism 
    JS conditional statements

Project 004
Temperature Converter Project

This project aims to create a temperature converter. The final version of the project includes three inputs for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature formats. When you change any of these inputs, for example, if you choose 100 degrees Celsius, you will see the equivalent Celsius value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin formats. Additionally, if you change one input, you will see a real-time change inside the other inputs. For instance, changing the Fahrenheit input to 100 degrees will show you that it is equal to 37 degrees Celsius and 311 Kelvin. To create this project, we will learn how to use an "onchange" event listener to track changes inside the inputs. We will also use the switch statement to track changes based on the name of the input we are working on. Additionally, we will use CSS to give the project a modern look, inspired by newMorphISM design. In summary, this project will help us learn how to create a temperature converter using JavaScript and CSS, and we will learn how to track changes using event listeners and switch statements.

Concepts learned 
    input eventlistiner
    change eventlistiner


Project 005
Dark Mode Toggle Project - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In this project, we'll create a toggle button that switches the website between dark and light modes, with a sliding animation for a more visually appealing transition. We'll use keyframe CSS queries to create the animation and JavaScript to change the background color dynamically. The user's preference will be stored using the browser's local storage, ensuring that their selection persists even if they refresh the page. This project will teach you advanced CSS techniques, JavaScript programming, and how to improve the user experience by storing data in the browser.

Concepts learned
    working wing with local storage
