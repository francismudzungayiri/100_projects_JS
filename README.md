Project 002
TIP CALCULATOR

In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator. The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS. We utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.

Concepts:
    DOM
    Eventlistiners
    getting input data


Project 003
BMI Calculator

This project aims to create a body mass index calculator. There are two input fields where the user can enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms. By clicking the "compute BMI" button, the BMI will be calculated and displayed along with the weight condition, which is determined by if statements based on the BMI. We will also install the project with a neumorphism design and use JavaScript to calculate the BMI. All results will be displayed inside the input field and at the end of the container.

Concepts learned:
    CSS nuemorphism 
    JS conditional statements
